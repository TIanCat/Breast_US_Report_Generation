**Abstrct:** Breast ultrasound (BUS) reports are important because subsequent treatment recommendations are based on them. However, the quality of BUS reports is easily affected by the experience of the radiologist, and writing ultrasound (US) reports is time-consuming and laborious. To alleviate these problems, we developed a transformer-based artificial intelligence (AI) system to automatically generate BUS reports from multi-modality and multi-view US images. A total of 878,090 US images and corresponding reports from 104,364 patients who underwent BUS examination were collected; of these, data from 103,664 patients were used for system development and quantitative evaluation, and data from 700 patients were used for qualitative expert evaluation. The expert evaluation results showed that the quality of the AI-generated reports was not significantly different from that of a mid-level radiologist with seven years of experience in BUS. The AI system helped three junior radiologists with approximately three years of BUS experience improve their diagnostic accuracy.

The overall design of this study. (a) Based on multi-modality and multi-view BUS images, the developed AI models generate findings and impressions in reports. (b) The reports generated by AI models were compared with a mid-level radiologist’s reports to evaluate the quality of the generated reports. (c) The reports of three junior radiologists with and without AI assistance were compared to evaluate the AI models’ assistance to junior radiologists.


## train
To train the finding model, please use the following command:
```
python train_cnn.py  -image_folder data/image   -train_path  data/split/train.json  -val_path data/split/val.json
```

To train the impression model, please use the following command:
```
python train_cat.py  -image_folder data/image   -train_path  data/split/train.json  -val_path data/split/val.json
```

## inference
To test the finding model, please use the following command:
```
python translate_cnn.py  -image_folder data/image   -test_path  data/split/test.json -model your_finding_model_path.pth
```

To test the impression model, please use the following command:
```
python translate_cat.py  -image_folder data/image   -test_path  data/split/test.json -model your_impression_model_path.pth
```

## demo
Online [Demo](http://www.ai4busrg.com/) of automatically generated BUS reports and expert evaluation.

## preprocessing
A Chinese sentence is divided into multiple words using the following function:
```
def chinese_split(chinese_str):
    seg_list = jieba.cut(chinese_str, cut_all=False)
    seg_str = " ".join(seg_list)
    return seg_str
```
To use the above function, you need to install jieba first：
```
pip install jieba
```
